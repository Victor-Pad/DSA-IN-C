### Purpose:

Here I'll be uploading the solutions to the exercises and projects during my _Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)_ studies. 

I'll use mostly two resources, a book and a Udemy course, which will be listed below. I'll introduce other, more advanced resources, as I become more familiar with DSA.

### Resources:

- **Book:** Data Structures & Program Design In C <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Program-Design-2nd/dp/013288366X">[Amazon Link]</a>
- **Udemy:** Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++ <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/">[Udemy Link]</a>
